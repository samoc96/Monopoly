# Monopoly
Team ID: 30b

**The Structure:**
- Source code located within Monopoly/src
- UML diagrams located within Monopoly/UML
    - Included JPEG files for diagrams created using Object Aid
    - Use case diagram created with Papyrus

**The Game:**
- One thing to note is that when rolling the dice you must hit 'Enter' twice as the first time is seen as an input.
- As this projected was completed alone I left out the following rules (still well above 50% of rules were implemented):
    - No Tokens
    - No Auctions
    - No restrictions on the number of houses to be built
    - Players may build multiple houses once monopoly is achieved for the property
        - i.e. Players not required to build evenly
    - When a player cannot pay the rent of a property to the owner, due to lack of money, the following occurs:
        - The owner receives the rent regardless of the players financial issues
        - The player with the financial issues money goes negative and all his assets are mortgaged
            - If after all his assets are mortgaged his money is still negative then he is declared bankrupt
            - The mortgaged assets are left with no owners and can be bought when landed on like before
    - Players not obliged to pay double rent when monopoly achieved


**Teamwork**:
- Unfortunately my partner was not prepared to put in the work for this project so I was left to implement it alone.
- I wasted a lot of time trying to encourgae him to produce classes to enable me to complete the project but it was a disaster.
- I was happy to get as much as I did done considering I was alone and wasted multiple weeks waiting for classes that never arrived.
